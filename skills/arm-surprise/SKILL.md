# Arm Surprise

## Overview

Run a short surprise motion that keeps the grip level, pulls back quickly, and returns slowly.

## Quick Start

```bash
python /home/pi/01/software/skills/arm-surprise/scripts/surprise.py
```

## Notes

- Keep motions small and safe unless explicitly requested.
- Always return to neutral angles.
